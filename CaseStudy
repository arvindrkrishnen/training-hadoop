### Import into Hive ORC

sqoop import --verbose --connect 'jdbc:mysql://localhost/people' --table persons --username root --hcatalog-table people_person --hcatalog-storage-stanza "stored as orc" -m 1 --create-hcatalog-table 

### Check from Beeswax on how the table has been created.

hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hue/HadoopTraining
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal webtraffic.log /user/hue/HadoopTraining

Verify if it got copied
hadoop fs -ls /user/hue/HadoopTraining

# Create Table in Beeswax UI 

# upload data from your desktop directly to HDFS as well from UI

# Update data onto the table from UI

# you will notice that few records did not get loaded and hence the upload failed. Find out which records did not get uploaded properly?

# Run basic SQL queries in these tables. Verify the performance.


# Analyze statistics
analyze table persons compute statistics;
analyze table webtraffic compute statistics;
